# social-linker
social-linker is about as simple as it gets: Nice looking shortcuts to social media websites. This app is for people that don't like or use social media apps, but want to easily check in every now and then. Works best if paired with a browser that blocks cross-site cookies and trackers, like Brave. The app is small and lightweight, and takes advantage of Ionic. 

To run each site within the app using Webview, hit the lock icon. 

To delete any sites, hit the delete icon then choose which you'd like to delete.

To add, hit the + icon. Colors are optional (will default to a dark grey).

- npm install

- ionic serve
